    Hope you are very comfortable with HTML tables and you are efficient in 
designing page layouts using HTML Tables. But you know CSS too provides 
plenty of controls for positioning elements in a document. Since CSS is the wave 
of the future, why not learn and use CSS instead of tables for page layout 
purposes?
The following list collects a few pros and cons of both the technologies:
 Most browsers support tables, while CSS support is being slowly adopted.
 Tables are more forgiving when the browser window size changes -
morphing their content and wrapping to accommodate the changes 
accordingly. CSS positioning tends to be exact and fairly inflexible.
 Tables are much easier to learn and manipulate than CSS rules.
But each of these arguments can be reversed:
 CSS is pivotal to the future of Web documents and will be supported by 
most browsers.
 CSS is more exact than tables, allowing your document to be viewed as 
you intended, regardless of the browser window.
 Keeping track of nested tables can be a real pain. CSS rules tend to be 
well organized, easily read, and easily changed.
Finally, we would suggest you to use whichever technology makes sense to you
and use what you know or what presents your documents in the best way.
CSS also provides table-layout property to make your tables load much faster.
